How to build a chatbot that doesnât suck AboutCasesBlogPartnersJobsð Let's ChatHow to build a chatbot that doesnât suckMarch 2, 20234 lessons I learned from building over 50 chatbots on 5 continentsAlmost everyone agrees that automated conversations can add value. As a customer, itâs much easier if you can communicate with a company or organization just as you do with your friends and family. No one likes to sit on hold in a telephone queue or wait three days for a response to their email.Â Instead, if AI could recognize your question, and resolve it or transfer it to the right person, the added value for both the user and the business is immense. Thatâs why âgoing conversationalâ is the next step forward in the way companies interact and communicate with their customers. However, for a technology that has so much potential, I always wonder why there are so many unsuccessful voice and chatbots?Â If you own a computer or a smartphone, then itâs safe to say that youâve had a conversation with a chatbot that makes you so frustrated, you want to throw your device out the window. Bots aim to make peopleâs lives easier, not add problems, so why are a majority of peopleâs interactions with bots so frustrating? The technology is there; itâs the implementation approach that needs updating.Â Over the last two and half years, I built more than 50 chatbots for companies from all industries in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. As with anything, there are always common mistakes that I see teams repeat when tackling a new chatbot project. There are four big lessons, that I learned and I promise you that, if you stick to these lessons, youâll not only build a bot that doesnât suck, but youâll build a bot that solves problems for your users and makes them feel heard and understood.Â âLesson 1: Anticipate the out of scopeÂ A chatbot project is an AI project, but frequently itâs run like a traditional IT project. The best way to explain the difference in approaches to a new project team is by comparing building a chatbot to building a website.Â A website has a predefined scope. The team agrees on the intended users, designs journeys to match their objectives and essentially decides which buttons appear where and what happens when the user clicks. The userâs actions are finite.Â Once thereâs a V1 of the website, the team tests to make sure everything works cross-device, that the buttons lead where theyâre supposed to, etc. They correct any bugs and set the site live!Now building a chatbot is an entirely different story. When you build a chatbot, you start with a scope. The team agrees on an information architecture, defines the botâs knowledge and responses, trains the NLP model, etc. However, we canât define the user journeys, because by giving the user a keyboard, the userâs actions become infinite.Â A keyboard opens up the possibility for a user to say literally anything and everything. This highlights the beauty and the potential of AI; instead of trying to understand how a website works and falling into a predefined journey, the user defines their own journey and experience with the chatbot.Â This means that even though we decide on an initial scope, people can still say whatever they want outside of this scope. And that can create issues that I refer to as false positives and true negatives.âExample 1: False positivesLetâs say someone asks something thatâs out of your scope. You can build your happy flows as well as you like, but when someone asks something thatâs out of your scope, it can very easily match an intent that you have in scope. Plus, the better and more robust your in-scope NLP model is, the chances increase that your user gets a false positive.Â Example of an NLP model giving a false positiveExample 2: True negativesWhen someone says something thatâs out of scope, and the bot correctly doesnât understand it. This is a true negative, which means the bot doesnât know how to answer the question and usually responds with some sort of ânot understoodâ sentence that asks the user to rephrase their question.Â However, the phrasing isnât the issue, and rephrasing the question wonât solve the problem, because the question is out of scope and considered a true not understood. The user and the bot become stuck in a ânot understoodâ loop.Â Example of an NLP model handling a true negativeSo, how can you avoid false positives and plan for true negatives? First, create what I refer to as â99-intents.â These are intents that capture categories and intents that arenât in scope. Their main purpose is to attract out of scope questions and define the correct next steps for the user.Â Second, make sure you correctly handle ânot understood.â Donât ask the user to rephrase. Instead, focus on how you can get the user to a solution as quickly as possible. Iâll dive into this more in Lesson 4.âLesson 2: Organize intents into a hierarchyLetâs use a banking bot for this lesson. A customer types that they lost their card, and the bot asks which card: debit or credit. The bot needs to know which card the user lost because the process is different depending on the card type. Great! Nothing bad happened yet :)Now the next user says that they lost their credit card, and again the bot asks which card they lost. The bot correctly recognized the intent, but itâs asking for additional information that the user already gave. This makes the user feel like the bot didnât properly understand them because no one likes to repeat themselves.Â The third user types that they lost their Amex Gold. The bot follows up by asking which card and the user repeats Amex Gold. The user is now stuck in a loop because this bot only expects debit or credit as an answer and doesnât realize Amex Gold is a credit card.To make sure this doesnât happen, you need to organize your content into a knowledge hierarchy. It goes from very broad to very specific.Â When a user asks a question, we want the bot to give the most specific answer possible. For example, if someone says that they lost their Amex Gold, we donât want to ask them if they lost their debit or their credit card.Â Itâs this possibility to immediately narrow in on the specific that makes AI so useful. Not only can users talk the way they normally do, they feel heard and can immediately receive an answer to their specific problem. Whereas, if this was a website, theyâd have to click 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 times to access the Amex Gold information.So how can you make sure we access the deepest level of information within a given intent? First, group all the similar intents and expressions together. Then, organize them from broad to specific. Finally, use different intents and specific entities for recognition and figuring out how âspecificâ the answer should be.Â âLesson 3: Expect unusual expressionsKeeping the banking theme, letâs start with an example that most banks in Belgium struggle with. Weâre making an intent for users requesting a new version of this little device Â ðWhat would you call this? Most people would say âcard reader.â Some say bank device, pin machine, digipassâ¦ In Belgium, people also say âbakjeâ or âkaskeâ which means small tray or container. Some people donât even use a specific word for this, they just say something like âthe thing I use to pay online.â When you start interacting with your customers, you realize that everyone expresses themselves differently.Â As humans, itâs pretty easy for us to understand âthe thing I use to pay online,â because we have context and can quickly figure out what the person means. However, a bot only knows what you teach it, so you need to make sure that all these variations are part of your AI model. This applies to single words, but also to sentences and situations. For example, when someone wants to express that their card is broken, they might say that while getting out of their car, they dropped their card in the door and closed it.Â This brings up the next question: how far do you need to go with this? In the above example, do you really want the bot to understand this? If you add this to the AI model, youâll have to include all kinds of words that have nothing to do with losing a card. And later on, as soon as someone mentions a car or a door, the AI will start thinking of a broken card. That might not be the result that youâre aiming for.Â Thereâs always a tradeoff when adding words and expressions that are unusual and divert from the more straightforward expressions because you donât want to take it too far. If a human would have trouble understanding what a person really means, thereâs no way we can expect a bot to understand.Â You should aim to train your NLP model to recognize 90% of the incoming user questions that are in scope. Depending on the bot and scope, you can get up to a 95% recognition rate, but I typically never train above that since the remaining 5% are usually edge cases and exceptions.Â So how can you anticipate all the creative ways users will describe an item or situation? Itâs all about testing and optimizing. When you first launch your bot, your NLP model will recognize ~70% of incoming, in-scope questions. Youâll need to review the incoming questions, update the NLP model with new expressions, set it live and repeat until you reach 90% recognition. Remember, a chatbot is an AI project that uses confidence scores, which means nothing is ever black and white.Â ââLesson 4: Remove: âSorry, I donât knowâ Often, when a bot doesnât understand someone, the reply is âSorry, I donât know the answer.âThe problem with that approach is that it doesnât help the user and it creates a negative experience. For example, when your wifi doesnât work, you contact your provider via their chatbot. If the bot doesnât understand what you said and responds with âSorry, I donât know,â you now have two problems: your wifi doesnât work and the bot doesnât understand you.Â The difference in a user's emotions before and after using a bad chatbotThis goes together with what I mentioned earlier about in-scope and out of scope expressions. If someone says something thatâs out of scope, the bot needs to realize that and provide an alternative solution.Â Going back to the wifi example. Instead of saying I donâtâ know. The bot can direct the user to an FAQ page, provide a link to a video that walks the user through resetting the modem, give the user the customer support phone number, offer to connect the user to a live agent, etc. There are so many ways the bot can help the user get closer to a solution, even if it canât solve the problem on its own. By helping the user get closer to a solution, the bot adds value, rather than adding frustration.Â At Campfire AI, we always develop an elaborate flow of safety nets. That way we make sure weâve exhausted every possible way to help the user before wrapping up.Â A not understood flow that triggers multiple safety nets before wrapping upâApplying these lessons so your next chatbot doesn't suckI never said it would be easy to build a chatbot that doesnât suck ;) But, I promise that if you apply these four lessons, youâll have a chatbot that helps bring your users closer to a solution.Â ââAbout the authorIvan accidentally found himself in the world of conversational AI when interviewing for a job at a marketing agency back in 2018.

A virtual tutor powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI)â AboutCasesBlogPartnersJobsð Let's ChatA virtual tutor powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI)âOnline learning offers students flexibility, but often lacks the guidance and support that's available in a traditional classroom. We worked together with university staff and used A.I. to develop a virtual tutor that guides students through their online course material.ââThe ProblemRemote studying can be a struggleâEvery summer, the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) runs an online chemistry course for incoming first year students. The course is designed to put everyone on a level playing field. To help students learn chemistry online, we developed a virtual study assistant to complement the online chemistry course.âThe solutionA virtual tutor that's available 24/7In collaboration with the professors and researchers from SIT, we reviewed the different course chapters and developed a hierarchical structure of hints to match the evaluation questions at the end of each chapter. The first hints are more generic, while the second and third hints are more specific to the question.âWe also added the answers to 100+ frequently asked questions that cover more generic chemistry content, such as explaining Avogadroâs Constant, the formula for calculating moles, and the definition of enthalpy or entropy.The resultsEngaging students in meaningful conversationâDuring the user research phase, 57% of the students indicated that they found the chatbot useful in answering questions. They commented that the chatbot is convenient to use and that having a conversation with a bot is more engaging and interactive than simply googling a question.56% of students also expressed that they would prefer an imperfect chatbot thatâs available 24/7 than an instructor available for a limited period of time.âAs part of a larger research project from SIT, weâll continue optimizing the bot and their team of professors and researchers will continue investigating the impact of a human tutor vs. a virtual tutor on course completion rates.

4,fire.ai post at what point should you invest in a bot,"fire.ai post at what point should you invest in a bot. At what point should you invest in a bot? AboutCasesBlogPartnersJobsð Let's ChatAt what point should you invest in a bot?November 4, 2022Chatbots are an investment, but they usually pay for themselves in < 1 year. Here's what to consider before you invest in your next bot.âA majority of our prospective customers come to us with the question: Whenâs the right time to start investing in a chatbot? Itâs a great question because building a chatbot is an investment. You need to dedicate resources to building a bot before you experience the value. âYou probably figured out already that our answer to this question is related to return on investment (ROI). And how do we measure ROI for a chatbot? Itâs simple, we use the time saved by the chatbot. There are other KPIs such as recognition rate and CSAT score, but the main KPI is time saved vs. bot cost. Basically, whatever you invest in the chatbot, you need to make back in time saved. âThere are a few reasons why we usually recommend starting with a pilot project, but one of the main reasons is that you should always validate that you can make back what the initial project costs in time saved by the bot. Below are the questions that we ask our prospective customers, as well as a Chatbot ROI Calculator to help you build your next chatbot business case.âQuestions to ask yourself before investing in a botâThere are two sets of questions that matter when deciding to invest in a chatbot project. The first set of questions helps you figure out whether or not you have a business case. The second set of questions helps you figure out the scope of your business case.âPart 1 - Do you have a business case?âThese are the basic questions that help you decide whether or not you have a solid need for conversational automation. At the end of the day, weâre very practical people. If you wonât experience a return on your investment, then itâs not worth it. Period. âEarly on a potential customer asked us to build them a bot. They had 20 conversations a day. We said no because weâd spend a lot of time building a fancy solution that would cost far more than the client would ever experience in saved time. It wasnât going to be a win-win. Weâre in business to enable people to focus on what truly matters by using AI to eliminate boring tasks. If we canât do that, then thereâs no point in launching a project. âHow many questions/interactions do you receive per month via chat?âAutomation works when there are high volumes. Because time saved is the main KPI, you obviously need enough conversations to make automating them worthwhile. There isnât a one number fits all answer, but generally, if you receive +2,000 conversations per month from one channel in one language, then youâre already in a good position to be considering a chatbot project.âWhat percentage of those questions/interactions do you want to automate?âNot every conversation can and should be automated by a chatbot. You want to select the percentage of incoming questions/interactions that can be automated. A modest estimate for a pilot project is 25% of the total. For more tips on which types of questions/interactions are best for automation, check out this article.âWhatâs the average time spent on answering a question or resolving an interactionâHow long does it take for a person to open the conversation, read it, find the answer, respond, confirm that the user doesnât have any remaining questions and close the conversation? Usually, this takes anywhere from 3-5 min. for easy-to-answer questions. For more complex flows that require data capture, the time can quickly increase to +10 min.âPart 2 - How much should I invest in my chatbot pilot project?âTo realize a return on investment, you need to figure out how much saved time it will take to cover the initial chatbot project costs. You should never invest more than you will save because itâd be faster and easier to flush your money down the toilet.âWhatâs the cost per day for someone to follow up/resolve those conversations?âThis is pretty straightforward. Just figure out the hourly rate of the person(s) handling those conversations. If it differs per profile, then take the average cost.âWhatâs your recognition rate?âThe recognition rate is the percentage of incoming questions that your chatbot recognizes correctly within your automation scope. At Campfire, we have a standard of 90%, but this can vary per implementation partner, so make sure to ask before agreeing to a project.âWhat are your costs?âThis includes your annual SaaS license fees, the full cost of your implementation project and the annual costs for general maintenance.âCalculating your chatbotâs ROIâNow that you know which questions to ask yourself, itâs time to plug in all the numbers and figure out the details of your business case! We'll walk you through an example, but download this free calculator to follow along and calculate your own business case ðâ! Please keep in mind that these calculations donât account for additional positive externalities such as productivity increases, reduced labor costs and revenue increases !âSmores Stadium is an arena in Brussels that hosts +100 events per year and its customer support team receives ~10,000 English messages per month via chat. The Customer Support Director, Marshall Mallow thinks that a chatbot should be his teamâs next hire, but he needs to convince the CEO with a solid business case. âAfter talking with Campfire, Marshall thinks that he can automate 25% of the incoming messages. He also estimates that it takes on average, 5 min. for an agent to resolve a chat. It costs âSmores Stadium 60,000 EUR per year to employ a customer support agent, which comes to â¬285 per day.Marshall plugs all of this info into the ROI Calculator and sees that he should save â¬80,000 per year! The initial estimate for the pilot project and the first year of the license is â¬45,000. This means that he has a 78% ROI and will recover his investment in less than a year!

5,fire.ai post can a chatbot help reduce hr ghosting by bridging the enthusiasm gap,"fire.ai post can a chatbot help reduce hr ghosting by bridging the enthusiasm gap. Can a chatbot reduce HR ghosting by bridging the enthusiasm gap?â AboutCasesBlogPartnersJobsð Let's ChatCan a chatbot reduce HR ghosting by bridging the enthusiasm gap?âFebruary 21, 2019If youâre a millennial whoâs gone on a few dates in the last 5 years, then youâre probably familiar with ghosting. In case youâre not, itâs when you go out on a date with someone, have a seemingly great time and then never see or hear from them again. In other words, they basically become a ghost. This phenomenon isnât exclusive to dating culture. After chatting with a few different recruiting managers, we realized that ghosting is a more common problem than you might think.In 2019, Indeed reported that 83% of surveyed companies experienced ghosting during the recruiting phase, while 1 in 5 new hires failed to show up for the first day of work. In a more recent study released in the first half of 2022, Brazen and TalentBoard identify ghosting as the top challenge for recruiters. Youâre probably thinking if humans canât stop people from ghosting, what makes us believe that a bot can hold people accountable for showing up? Because bots can keep the conversation going, while humans canât or donât have time, and it all has to do with bridging the HR enthusiasm gap.What is the HR enthusiasm gap?âThe enthusiasm gap is exactly what it sounds like. As job seekers find, apply and interview for jobs, their enthusiasm generally builds, especially, the further along they are in the interview process. Enthusiastic employees are more valuable to a company because theyâre generally more engaged, positive, productive and inspiring than their less enthusiastic colleagues. However, once someone signs their new contract, resigns from their current position and begins their notice period, their enthusiasm tends to take a steady downturn.Whether theyâre caught up in handovers, start second-guessing their decisions, or are approached by other companies for positions they previously applied to, new hires are stuck in this weird limbo during their notice period. Notice periods can last anywhere from 3 to 12 weeks, and during this time, the new employer goes radio silent and the new recruit starts to feel disconnected from or even ghosted by their new employer. However, suppose you can bridge this period with a pre-boarding program that maintains the current level of enthusiasm or builds on it leading up to the first day, not only do you reduce the chances of ghosting. In that case, you also start the employeeâs first day and onboarding process at a much higher level of enthusiasm.What are the benefits of bridging the enthusiasm gap?âBefore diving into how to bridge the enthusiasm gap, letâs address why you should bridge the enthusiasm. A.K.A. Whatâs in for you?Benefits for recruitersâð» Fewer ghostsâKeeping new recruits engaged during their notice period with a pre-boarding program makes it much harder for them to disappear into thin air.ð° Avoid extra hiring costsâThe hiring process is expensive. If your first choice declines the offer, then you move on to your second choice. However, when a new signee ghosts, you need to restart the entire hiring process for the same position, because you already closed the vacancy and informed the other candidates that the position is filled. In the end, it costs double to fill a single position.ð¾ Save time in the long runâNot only is the hiring process expensive, itâs also time-consuming. Finding candidates, reading resumes, scheduling and hosting interviews, following up, negotiating contractsâ¦ It takes a lot of time to do it once. Now imagine having to do it twiceâ¦âºï¸ Happier colleaguesâWhen a candidate signs a contract, it can be just as exciting for the future team as it is for the candidate. Most of the time, teammates look forward to the new employeeâs start date. When a new employee doesnât show up on the first day, it can have the team feeling anything between disappointed and annoyed to devastated and enraged. In short, no ghosts = happier colleagues.Benefits for recruiteesâð§ Smoother transitionâBridging the enthusiasm gap with a pre-boarding program gives new hires a smoother transition into their new company, team and role. They start familiarizing themselves with their new job so that on their first day theyâre more comfortable and spend less time trying to figure out whoâs who and whatâs what.ð§ Reduced stress and anxietyâThe night-before jitters are a real thing. Imagine if you had someone who was available to answer all those last-minute questions you forgot to ask the hiring manager or werenât included in your new bossâs welcome mail. How helpful would that be for easing your mind and prepping your work bag for the first day?â¡ Faster integrationâBy maintaining contact and keeping up enthusiasm during the notice period, new recruits learn more about the company and culture so that they assimilate more quickly. They know what to expect and they can ask their questions when they pop up instead of waiting for 3 weeks and ultimately forgetting. They also feel like theyâre already a part of the company before they officially begin.ð Increased productivityâWhen new recruits start, they often spend the first day trying to figure out how to log in to their email. The next three weeks arenât that much more productive either. Asking for access to different company tools, learning whoâs who, trying to figure out where the printer is locatedâ¦ These are all things that take time and energy away from doing the job you hired them to do. If you covered all these basic questions during a pre-boarding phase not only would they maintain a connection with your company during their notice period, theyâd hit the ground running and be ready to go on their first day.How can a chatbot bridge the HR enthusiasm gap?âA chatbot canât do everything, but it sure can help with a lot of things, including bridging the enthusiasm gap.Here are 6 reasons why chatbot is perfect for automating employee pre-boarding and onboarding and ultimately reducing ghosting.1. Itâs personalizedâA bot answers exactly what your new hire asks when they ask it. You can also set up time-triggered flows and messages to engage the new hire at key moments before their start date. Ex. Ask for banking details 2 weeks prior to the start date, or send a good luck message the night before.2. Itâs interactive and instantaneous.âInstead of waiting hours or days for a response, new hires receive an answer instantly. They can also ask follow-up questions, which makes the experience interactive and engaging.3. Neutralize unfair advantagesâSome managers are great at reaching out to new hires before their start date and prepping them for their first day and week. Others, not so much. Using a chatbot relieves new managers of this pressure and puts all new employees on the same playing field. Every new hire has access to the same information and support.4. Streamline communicationâA chatbot is consistent in how it responds. You only need to update the information in one place and then itâs the same answer for everyone who asks that question. It also serves as one central point of contact for new hires to visit and ask questions.5. Strengthen employer brandingâYou define what your chatbot answers and how it responds. So itâs always in line with your employer branding and company culture.6. Save time and resourcesâInstead of wading through your overflowing inbox and spending time answering the same question over and over, you sit down once and define the answers once. From that moment on, you wonât have to answer those questions again. Youâll just need to make small updates when there are changes to policies or updated information.NameEmail AddressCOMPANY* I read and agree with Campfireâs Privacy PolicyHeck yes!

A smart chatbot can scale your crisis communicationâ AboutCasesBlogPartnersJobsð Let's ChatA smart chatbot can scale your crisis communicationâFast and accurate communication is critical during a crisis. But, it can be challenging to manage the mass influx of questions that accompany a crisis. We worked together with the European Parliament to build a smart chatbot that answers employee questions in real-time.ââThe ProblemQuickly communicating at scaleâIn a matter of hours, the Corona virus forced a majority of the European workforce to leave their offices and set-up a desk at home. Many companies lacked an official remote working policy, which only added to the confusion and stress caused by a global pandemic.âThe European Parliament (E.P.) immediately recognized the importance of accurate communication during a crisis and briefed Campfire to build its first smart chatbot to help streamline and accelerate communication with its 11.000 employees stationed across Europe.The solutionReal-time answers to questionsâA.I. (artificial intelligence) is the best technology for answering a high volume of questions. By layering a basic chatbot with a robust A.I., we can ensure that the chatbot is ""smart"" and understands a wide variety of user questions. In less than a week, we published a first version of the chatbot the E.P.'s intranet. This bot could answer 50+ different questions about the Corona virus, the Corona crisis and the E.P.'s remote working policy. Because the pandemic evolved rapidly, we monitored the conversations daily. This allowed us to identify gaps in the bot's knowledge database and improve the A.I. with continuous NLP (natural language processing) training. We also worked with health department experts to regularly update the bot with new information and regulations.âThe resultsQuick adoption and even quicker answersâIn the first 6 months of the crisis, the bot answered 15.000 questions from E.P. employees. Using A.I. to build a smart chatbot meant that the HR Team and other internal experts could ensure that they answered employee questions in real-time and with accurate information. It also gave the E.P.'s internal team the flexibility to focus on more complicated cases that required individual follow-up. âWeeklyCONTENT UPDATES 15,000QUESTIONS ANSWERED IN THE FIRST 6 MONTHSCompanyWorkPartnersJobsResourcesBlogThe Best Bots 2022AboutAbout CampfirePrivacy policyCopyright Â© 2022 Campfire AIThis site uses cookiesWe care about your data, and we'd use cookies only to improve your experience.

11,fire.ai post what is conversational banking,"fire.ai post what is conversational banking. What is conversational banking? AboutCasesBlogPartnersJobsð Let's ChatWhat is conversational banking?November 4, 2022Conversational banking is exactly what it sounds like: itâs when a financial institution uses conversational AI to answer banking and insurance questions. Put simply, itâs a bankâs chatbot.âConversational banking uses natural language processing (NLP), which is a fancy way of saying AI for words. Like any other chatbot, we built the NLP model using intents, expressions, entities and flows.ââââââââââWhen a user asks a chatbot a question, we refer to that as an expression. For example, the user asks, âHow do I cancel my credit card?â The bot processes the userâs expression and compares it to the different expressions within its NLP model. Each expression within the NLP model is associated with a specific intent, or answer to an expected question. The bot then assigns a confidence score to each intent, and based on the different thresholds and rules that we define, it responds to the user with the appropriate answer.A look into how a chatbot assigns confidence scoresâWhy is conversational AI interesting for the banking sector?âBanking is the perfect business case for conversational AI because banks and insurance providers have thousands of customers who use their services multiple times a day. This inevitably leads to problems that need solving and questions that need answering.Most of the incoming questions are repetitive, easy to recognize and easy to answer. This is the trifecta for conversational AI automation, making it a win-win for banks and customers.ââð¾ Save resourcesâOn average, banks implementing a basic chatbot save between 10-20% of an agentâs time. The customer support agents can repurpose their saved time to focus on more complex cases that need human attention.ââ Reduce human errorâHumans make mistakes; it just happens sometimes. Whereas a chatbot follows standardized, pre-programmed logic, making it almost impossible to make mistakes.âð¤³ Interact with customers where they areâA chatbot can live almost anywhere: on your website, in your app, WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, etc. By placing your chatbot where your customers already are, you widen your customer reach and reduce the barrier to connect.âð¸ Focus on upsellingâInstead of spending time answering the same question 20 times a day, a customer support agent can delegate these types of tasks to a chatbot. They then have the time to focus on resolving complex client issues and upselling clients.ââBenefits for customersââ¡ Instant answersâA chatbot is available 24/7 and can answer a userâs question in seconds. This is a significant contrast when compared to more traditional question-and-answer approaches. For example, think about when a customer had to wait on the phone line for 10-30 minutes for a representative to pick up or send an email and wait a few days for a response. With a chatbot, your customers ask whenever is most convenient for them and they receive an instant response. There are no opening hours, no queues and no waiting times.âð¯ Personalized experiencesâItâs easy to connect your chatbot to your CRM system. This allows you to identify your customers and tailor the conversation to their needs and profile. For example, if youâre logged into your banking app and trying to file an insurance claim, the bot can look up your existing policy and respond with an answer tailored to your insurance policy. Each userâs experience with the chatbot is customized and unique.âð¬ Interactive communicationâItâs much more enjoyable and efficient to have an interactive conversation rather than trying to fill out a form that doesnât allow you to express your problem or fighting with an IVR system that doesnât understand your request. Chatbots are flexible and trained to solve problems and answer questions.âð® Omni-channel accessibilityWe can place a chatbot on almost any channel, making it much easier for your customers to connect with you via the channel that they prefer. This allows them to seamlessly switch between channels and makes it a more convenient experience for everyone.âWhat are the best use cases for conversational banking?âLike any other industry, a chatbot can support all types of departments and roles. Here are some different implementations for banking chatbots:Answer frequently asked questionsSell new plans and upgradesRegister and onboard new clientsRemind users of upcoming payments and deadlinesCoach and motivate users to stick to their budget and savings goalsRequest a new card readerRaise your daily limitPlan your budgetCheck your balanceMake a transferPay your billsFile an insurance claimIf youâre eager to dive deeper into some actual business cases, check out our work for Argenta and Rawbank.âWhatâs next?âBanks will inevitably continue adopting conversational AI to automate frequently asked questions, execute transactions and streamline processes. Financial institutions that donât make this switch wonât be able to sustain the increasing volume of incoming questions and remain competitive.Are you interested in implementing a chatbot at your company?

12,fire.ai smores how to scope your next chatbot project,"fire.ai smores how to scope your next chatbot project. How to scope your next chatbot project AboutCasesBlogPartnersJobsð Let's ChatHow to scope your next chatbot projectNovember 4, 2022When sitting down to decide what information your chatbot should know (i.e. scoping your chatbot), youâre actually trying to predict what questions your future users will ask. And by giving your users a keyboard, youâre opening up the list of possible questions to include literally everything and anything. âWhen a user asks a question, your bot will use natural language processing (NLP) to try and determine the intent (or purpose) of your userâs question. These intents are the building blocks of your botâs knowledge. For your bot to recognize an intent, you need to identify what questions your users will ask, build an NLP model based on that information and train your bot with +40 expressions per intent. âThereâs a big difference between what your bot could know and what it should know. But to get to the should, you need to start with the could. Below we share our favorite places to look for possible intents and our tips on selecting the most impactful ones. Because at the end of the day, your chatbot needs to save you time and money.âGather all the possible intentsâThe scoping phase of a chatbot project is when you gather all the possible intents. This is the time to dig out a magnifying glass and play Sherlock Holmes. Just like a detective, you need to poke around in the dusty corners, interview witnesses and listen for the truth. This is the phase where youâll look into all the possible questions your bot could answer. If youâre feeling impatient and want to know what your bot should answer, skip ahead to the next section.âStart with the FAQsâThereâs a reason companies have FAQsâ theyâre the select set of questions that users ask the most. Not only do you already know that these are high-volume questions, but the content is also structured and the answers are there! It's almost a perfect outline for your chatbot's scope. All you need to do is rework the questions to match a single intent and rewrite the copy to fit a conversation.âChat with your customer support teamâNo one knows your users better than your customer support agents. They interact with and solve your usersâ questions and issues daily. Most customer support teams have a knowledge library of questions and answers beyond the basic FAQs. Similar to an FAQ, you can assume that users ask these questions repeatedly, and thereâs already a clear outline of how the bot should answer.âCustomer support teams are also your gateway to the âinformation universe.â They manage the access to the digital archive of all past user conversations, and in most cases, they classify these conversations with topics, tags, and have template responses. This is a friendly warning that reading through real user conversations can lead you down the black hole of information overload, but we swear that this is the best way to understand who your bot will talk to and how theyâll respond to it. âIn case youâre still not convinced, the final reason to involve your customer support agents in scoping your chatbot is that theyâll be your botâs direct colleagues. When your bot canât close a user request on its own, your customer support agents will take over the conversation via an offload flow. You need to know how they work to design a bot that will help them, and they need to understand how the bot will work to help users better.âReview company documentationâIs there an onboarding manual? Or a handbook of company processes? Since this is information that your company wants to share with employees, partners, customers and more, itâs a great thing to read for inspiration. Youâll be pleasantly surprised how many intents you can find in a basic About-CompanyX.pdf.âIdentify the manual processesâChatbots exist to automate repetitive tasks. Basic manual processes inspire some of the best intents and future conversational flows.A common manual process is data capture. You can easily put the bot in charge of collecting and updating user data, so that your human colleagues can focus on more complex tasks. Managing appointments, routing to the right queue and sending reminders are other processes that a chatbot can easily take over.âTurn user questions into chatbot intentsâQuestions and intents are similar, but not the same. A question is literally what your user asks, while an intent is the purpose of what your user asks. For example, a user asks Hey Google! Whatâs the number for Amyâs Pizza? The Hey Googleâ¦ is the question, but 01-restaurant-contact-info is the intent.Transforming a question into an intent isnât always easy. The key is to capture the essence in one to three words. A good rule of thumb is that if your intent doesnât fit on a post-it, itâs too long.âChoose the best intentsâNow that you have a collection of possible intents, itâs time to decide which intents will have the largest potential impact and therefore, the highest priority. For a pilot project, we recommend starting with ~20 intents. Itâs always better to get a small set of intents working well before making a dumpster of half-understood intents.âLook for the trifectaâThe best intents are the ones that are repetitive, easy to recognize and easy to answer. When you find this trifecta, put this intent at the top of your implementation backlog.But how do you know if you have a trifecta? We use a systematic framework to visualize which intents will have the largest potential impact.âRecognizability: Can a bot easily recognize this intent? Is it clear and unique, or very vague, or similar to other intents?âRepetitiveness: How frequent is this intent? Will it be triggered 200 times a day or twice a day? Â âEasiness: How simple or complex is it to implement this intent? Do we need to use APIs, create a microservice, etc.? âReview each intent and give it a score from 1-10 for recognizable and repetitive (1 being the least and 10 being the most). Then give the intent a score from 1-5 based on how easy itâll be to implement (1 being the easiest and 5 being the most difficult). Now itâs time to map each intent on a graph; recognizability is on the y-axis and repetitiveness is on the x-axis. Once you have the coordinates for an intent, mark it with its easiness score.A cluster in the top right quadrant will appear. These are the intents that you should prioritize for your chatbot. Start with the easiest intents to implement, and then work your way up through the more difficult ones.Any intents that donât make the list for the pilot should go on your backlog so that you can pick them up to include in future releases.âA chatbotâs knowledge isnât staticâLaunching your bot is only the beginning. This is one of our favorite diagrams of all time because itâs so simple, yet so accurate ðThe best source of new intents for your chatbot comes from its users. Once your bot is live, take time to review the incoming conversations. This allows you to make sure that the botâs recognizing existing intents correctly and to see what other questions users ask that are currently not in scope. âLook for patterns and figure out how the bot could answer that question instead of putting it in a not understood flow. Your priority should be to make every experience a neutral or positive experience for the user. Looking at the missed questions gives you all the necessary information to increase your botâs knowledge. The best bots grow continuously and are updated regularly to answer actual user questions.

13,fire.ai post how to audit your chatbot in 20 min or less,"fire.ai post how to audit your chatbot in 20 min or less. How to audit your chatbot in 20 min. or less AboutCasesBlogPartnersJobsð Let's ChatHow to audit your chatbot in 20 min. or lessMarch 7, 2023As a boutique consulting company specialized in conversational AI, we spend a lot of time auditing chatbots. Weâve pretty much got it down to a science at this point. Using our audit methodology and checklist, weâll walk you through how to prep, test and score your bot in less than 20 minutes. âAlways use an audit checklistFirst and foremost, use checklist to help you audit your chatbot. Why? Because unfortunately, our minds arenât as sharp at 25+ as they were at 12â¦ we forget things. Not only does the checklist help you remember everything, it also keeps you focused and instantly highlights opportunities for improvement.Â âDonât have an audit checklist? Weâve got you covered! Our audit checklist is a robust one-pager that covers the four most important pillars that make up a strong chatbot:NLP qualityConversational designStructure and flowsVisualizationScroll down to the end of this post to download your own copy ðâStep 1: Prep your questions (~5 min.)We recommend prepping 15 questions that you can ask your bot. We always start from a generic list of 10 questions and then adapt those based on the target audience using the bot, the placement of the bot and the company. If youâre lacking inspiration, you can always check out our base list of questions in this article.âStep 2: Test the bot (~10 min.)Now itâs time to test your bot! Ask the bot your 15 questions and note how it responds: true positive, false positive, false negative or true negative. Then run through the rest of the checklist testing the different criteria and recording the results. Once you reach the end itâs time to move on to the next step.âStep 3: Tally up the score (~5 min.)This is the easy partâ¦ Add up the scores for each section and then calculate the total score out of 50. Youâll immediately see which areas the bot performs well and which areas need improvement. This will help you focus your optimization efforts.âOther tricks for auditing your chatbot quicklyAfter testing 100+ bots, weâve perfected the bot testing setup. Here are a few habits that we use to make sure our tests run smoothly.âUse two screensAfter a lot of trial and error, we found that the best way to efficiently test a chatbot is to use two screens. We like the open the bot on our laptop and have the audit checklist and questions open on our second screen.Â This setup makes it easy to copy and paste the questions into the bot instead of losing time typing them out.Â âTake notes as you goThis is crucial. As youâre moving quickly, ideas come and go just as quickly. I promise you wonât regret this. Plus it makes referring back to a test a few hours, days or months later so much easier.Â âUse a color code systemColor allows us to see quickly how a bot performed on NLP quality. We highlight true positives in green, false positives in red, false negatives in orange and leave true negatives as is.Â You can use any color combination that you like. The idea is to pick a set of colors that stand out from one another to make counting at the end quick and easy.Â âHave all your devices near youThis is a simple one, but make sure you have a tablet and phone next to you so you donât have to get up partway through testing and try to find it.Â âRecord your testing sessionScreen recordings are a lifesaver. AI is like a black box and weird stuff happens. It just does. After experiencing weird things and then trying to recreate them with different results, we resorted to recording each testing session. This allows us to revisit a test later on as well as show our developers and conversational AI consultants what went wrong so they can look into the conversation history and pinpoint the error.Â Audit your bot in <20 minutesFill out your info on the right to receive a download link for an editable version of our Bot Audit Checklist!NameEmail AddressCOMPANY* I read and agree with Campfireâs Privacy PolicyHeck yes!

Sam and Sono are chatbots that troubleshoot your login issues AboutCasesBlogPartnersJobsð Let's ChatSam and Sono are chatbots that troubleshoot your login issuesSam and Sono are Sabamâs dynamic chatbot duo. Theyâre based on the login pages of mySabam and myUnisono respectively, and only pop up to introduce themselves when a user fails to log in.The ProblemUsers couldnât log in to their accountsSabam is the Belgian association of authors, composers and publishers, and Unisono is their online platform where users can apply for licenses. With more than 45,000 members, the customer support team receives daily messages from members asking for help logging into one of their two platforms.âAfter reviewing Sabam and Unisonoâs conversation history, we noticed that most of the login issues were the same and were solved quickly by asking two to three follow-up questions. This meant that this was the perfect use case for automation; the questions were repetitive, easy to resolve and easy to understand. The solutionChatbots that guide users step-by-step to a solutionWorking closely with Sabam and Unisono, we identified the most common login errors, such as typing your password with CAPS LOCK on, using the letter âOâ instead of the number â0,â etc. Based on those errors, we designed conversational flows that guide the user through their own troubleshooting.Â âAs soon as the user fails to log in, Sam or Sono pops up asking if they can assist the user. Both chatbots combine click and free-type flows to guide users and help them resolve their login issues as quickly as possible. The resultsFaster logins and less time wastedâThe login chatbots handle +3.000 conversations a month and solve 97% of the login issues in under 3 minutes. Not only are users happier and able to login in faster, but the Sabam and Unisono customer service representatives have more time to focus on answering questions that require human follow-up.+3,000conversations a month97%of login issues solved> 3 min.to solve an issueCompanyWorkPartnersJobsResourcesBlogThe Best Bots 2022AboutAbout CampfirePrivacy policyCopyright Â© 2022 Campfire AIThis site uses cookiesWe care about your data, and we'd use cookies only to improve your experience.

17,fire.ai case posts to yoda say hello proximuss internal support chatbot hmmmmm,"fire.ai case posts to yoda say hello proximuss internal support chatbot hmmmmm. To YODA say hello, Proximus's internal support chatbot AboutCasesBlogPartnersJobsð Let's ChatTo YODA say hello, Proximus's internal support chatbotYODA, short for Your Own Digital Assistant, is Proximusâs virtual assistant. Proximus is the largest telco company in Belgium, and as a member of the HR Team, YODAâs stationed on the intranet to answer questions from +10,000 employees in Dutch and French. Boasting the knowledge of a Jedi Master, heâs trained with +94,000 expressions to recognize ~700 intents.âThe ProblemHow can we restore a chatbot to its former glory?ââAs one of the first chatbots launched in Belgium back in 2019, YODA needed a retune. His natural language processing (NLP) model was confused, so he either didnât understand the question to begin with or responded with the wrong answer. This is a more common problem than bot owners think because project owners change, updates arenât documented, content is forgotten about, duplicate intents are created, etc.âFortunately, YODAâs structural bones were great! The content hierarchy, basic flows and breadth of intents were on point. All the confusion centered in the NLP model, which is basically his brain. Since YODA is a massive chatbot, we quickly realized this wasnât going to be an optimization project that could fit in a two-week sprint. Together with the Proximus team, we broke the project up into four phases:ContentNLP modelNew featuresDocumentationUsing our NLP expertise and bot-building best practices, we worked on fixing the broken to restore YODA to his wise self.The solutionSetting up a multi-phased chatbot optimization projectââYODA's NLP quality and subsequent user experience declined over time. By introducing a ""fix the broken"" project, we restored YODA to his wise self. Content: Updating YODAâs responses and knowledge to match the correct informationâStarting with the content gave us the opportunity to get to know YODA and familiarize ourselves with the different topics, intents and flows. Together with the HR Team, we reviewed all the existing bot copy and highlighted what needed to be removed, added or updated. For example, Proximusâs mobility policy changed, so we needed to adapt the existing bot responses to match the new policy. There were also new employee benefits such as ecocheques, which meant that we needed to create new intents for those new benefits.These types of content updates are relatively easy to make, but itâs something that needs to be done regularly as information and policies change. Otherwise, the content becomes messy and outdated, and the changes pile up in a gigantic backlog.NLP model: Cleaning up YODAâs confusion âCleaning up the NLP model is the most intensive phase of any chatbot optimization project. We began with a master list of all the intents currently in YODA. Then we went through each intent one by one to review the name and expressions. We implemented naming conventions to make it easier to recognize and find intents. We then checked the expressions to make sure that they matched the intent, removed any that didnât match, and added expressions to make sure there were +40 per intent. Some intents were very similar to another, so we merged them to eliminate any confusion, and deleted any duplicate intents. We also review existing conversations to add real user expressions to the matching intent or make a note of an intent thatâs not yet covered by YODAâs knowledge so that we could add it to the backlog and include it in a future release. Then it was testing, testing and more testing.A conversation in Dutch where YODA recognizes that the employee has a question about insurance, but he needs to clarify specifically what (s)he wants to know before answering.Offloading to a live chat is a common practice that we use in customer support implementations, but quite rare in HR implementations. Itâs normal that a bot canât answer everything, so then we need to design the experiences when a bot canât answer to be as frictionless as possible for the user. Based on our experience with customer support chatbots, we proposed introducing a live chat handover. When YODA canât answer a question, he proposes to send the user to one of his human colleagues for further assistance. If the user agrees, YODA alerts one of his HR colleagues and shares the conversation history, so they can easily pick up the conversation where YODA left off. The user keeps the chat window open and in a few minutes, a human colleague joins that same chat to help solve their problem. YODAâs main objective is to automate everything that can be automated so that his human colleagues can focus on these more complex conversations. By integrating with Interact, a live agent handover solution, we make it possible for human colleagues to jump in and support YODA when he needs help solving an employee's request.A conversation in French where YODA recognizes that the employee has a question about insurance, but he needs to clarify specifically what (s)he wants to know before answering.Documentation: Making sure itâs clear how YODA works, so this problem doesnât happen againâDocumentation is crucial for a successful bot in the long run. We like to create a Miro board to have a visualization of the flows, copy and technical logic in one place. We also generate an NLP gatekeeper document so that we have a searchable overview of all the intents, expressions and bot responses linked.We use the Miro as our single source of truth because itâs easy to zoom in on certain flows and visualize how one flow connects to another. The Miro board also allows for collaboration with non-technical project stakeholders. Its easy-to-use interface means that anyone can comment, add notes, propose changes, etc.âYODA's conversational flow about employee allowances visualized and validated in Miro before building anything in Chatlayer.An NLP gatekeeper document links the intents, expressions and bot responses in an easy-to-search Excel file. In bot platforms, this information is usually fragmented in different windows, so itâs difficult to have an overview of all the questions and answers.âA screenshot from YODA's NLP gatekeeper documentThe resultsSave time, YODA doesâSince YODAâs relaunch in 2022, the annual volume of HR tickets went from +30,000 to ~14,000. He handles +6,600 conversations a month and only offloads 1.17% of those conversations to human colleague. On average he saves the HR team ~41 days of work per month!In an internal survey, 50% of Proximusâs employees indicated that they prefer talking to YODA than creating a support ticket or calling the HR helpline. The HR Team expects this percentage to increase as existing employees become more familiar with YODA and younger employees join the company. â41 DAYSOF WORK SAVED EVERY MONTH+6,600CONVERSATIONS HANDLED PER MONTH1.17%CONVERSATIONS ARE OFFLOADEDCompanyWorkPartnersJobsResourcesBlogThe Best Bots 2022AboutAbout CampfirePrivacy policyCopyright Â© 2022 Campfire AIThis site uses cookiesWe care about your data, and we'd use cookies only to improve your experience.

19,fire.ai post how to scope your next chatbot project,"fire.ai post how to scope your next chatbot project. How to scope your next chatbot project AboutCasesBlogPartnersJobsð Let's ChatHow to scope your next chatbot projectNovember 4, 2022When sitting down to decide what information your chatbot should know (i.e. scoping your chatbot), youâre actually trying to predict what questions your future users will ask. And by giving your users a keyboard, youâre opening up the list of possible questions to include literally everything and anything. âWhen a user asks a question, your bot will use natural language processing (NLP) to try and determine the intent (or purpose) of your userâs question. These intents are the building blocks of your botâs knowledge. For your bot to recognize an intent, you need to identify what questions your users will ask, build an NLP model based on that information and train your bot with +40 expressions per intent. âThereâs a big difference between what your bot could know and what it should know. But to get to the should, you need to start with the could. Below we share our favorite places to look for possible intents and our tips on selecting the most impactful ones. Because at the end of the day, your chatbot needs to save you time and money.âGather all the possible intentsâThe scoping phase of a chatbot project is when you gather all the possible intents. This is the time to dig out a magnifying glass and play Sherlock Holmes. Just like a detective, you need to poke around in the dusty corners, interview witnesses and listen for the truth. This is the phase where youâll look into all the possible questions your bot could answer. If youâre feeling impatient and want to know what your bot should answer, skip ahead to the next section.âStart with the FAQsâThereâs a reason companies have FAQsâ theyâre the select set of questions that users ask the most. Not only do you already know that these are high-volume questions, but the content is also structured and the answers are there! It's almost a perfect outline for your chatbot's scope. All you need to do is rework the questions to match a single intent and rewrite the copy to fit a conversation.âChat with your customer support teamâNo one knows your users better than your customer support agents. They interact with and solve your usersâ questions and issues daily. Most customer support teams have a knowledge library of questions and answers beyond the basic FAQs. Similar to an FAQ, you can assume that users ask these questions repeatedly, and thereâs already a clear outline of how the bot should answer.âCustomer support teams are also your gateway to the âinformation universe.â They manage the access to the digital archive of all past user conversations, and in most cases, they classify these conversations with topics, tags, and have template responses. This is a friendly warning that reading through real user conversations can lead you down the black hole of information overload, but we swear that this is the best way to understand who your bot will talk to and how theyâll respond to it. âIn case youâre still not convinced, the final reason to involve your customer support agents in scoping your chatbot is that theyâll be your botâs direct colleagues. When your bot canât close a user request on its own, your customer support agents will take over the conversation via an offload flow. You need to know how they work to design a bot that will help them, and they need to understand how the bot will work to help users better.âReview company documentationâIs there an onboarding manual? Or a handbook of company processes? Since this is information that your company wants to share with employees, partners, customers and more, itâs a great thing to read for inspiration. Youâll be pleasantly surprised how many intents you can find in a basic About-CompanyX.pdf.âIdentify the manual processesâChatbots exist to automate repetitive tasks. Basic manual processes inspire some of the best intents and future conversational flows.A common manual process is data capture. You can easily put the bot in charge of collecting and updating user data, so that your human colleagues can focus on more complex tasks. Managing appointments, routing to the right queue and sending reminders are other processes that a chatbot can easily take over.âTurn user questions into chatbot intentsâQuestions and intents are similar, but not the same. A question is literally what your user asks, while an intent is the purpose of what your user asks. For example, a user asks Hey Google! Whatâs the number for Amyâs Pizza? The Hey Googleâ¦ is the question, but 01-restaurant-contact-info is the intent.Transforming a question into an intent isnât always easy. The key is to capture the essence in one to three words. A good rule of thumb is that if your intent doesnât fit on a post-it, itâs too long.âChoose the best intentsâNow that you have a collection of possible intents, itâs time to decide which intents will have the largest potential impact and therefore, the highest priority. For a pilot project, we recommend starting with ~20 intents. Itâs always better to get a small set of intents working well before making a dumpster of half-understood intents.âLook for the trifectaâThe best intents are the ones that are repetitive, easy to recognize and easy to answer. When you find this trifecta, put this intent at the top of your implementation backlog.But how do you know if you have a trifecta? We use a systematic framework to visualize which intents will have the largest potential impact.âRecognizability: Can a bot easily recognize this intent? Is it clear and unique, or very vague, or similar to other intents?âRepetitiveness: How frequent is this intent? Will it be triggered 200 times a day or twice a day? Â âEasiness: How simple or complex is it to implement this intent? Do we need to use APIs, create a microservice, etc.? âReview each intent and give it a score from 1-10 for recognizable and repetitive (1 being the least and 10 being the most). Then give the intent a score from 1-5 based on how easy itâll be to implement (1 being the easiest and 5 being the most difficult). Now itâs time to map each intent on a graph; recognizability is on the y-axis and repetitiveness is on the x-axis. Once you have the coordinates for an intent, mark it with its easiness score.A cluster in the top right quadrant will appear. These are the intents that you should prioritize for your chatbot. Start with the easiest intents to implement, and then work your way up through the more difficult ones.Any intents that donât make the list for the pilot should go on your backlog so that you can pick them up to include in future releases.âA chatbotâs knowledge isnât staticâLaunching your bot is only the beginning. This is one of our favorite diagrams of all time because itâs so simple, yet so accurate ðThe best source of new intents for your chatbot comes from its users. Once your bot is live, take time to review the incoming conversations. This allows you to make sure that the botâs recognizing existing intents correctly and to see what other questions users ask that are currently not in scope. âLook for patterns and figure out how the bot could answer that question instead of putting it in a not understood flow. Your priority should be to make every experience a neutral or positive experience for the user. Looking at the missed questions gives you all the necessary information to increase your botâs knowledge. The best bots grow continuously and are updated regularly to answer actual user questions.

20,fire.ai case posts cases argenta meet charlie,"fire.ai case posts cases argenta meet charlie. Meet Charlie, Belgium's most helpful customer support chatbot AboutCasesBlogPartnersJobsð Let's ChatMeet Charlie, Belgium's most helpful customer support chatbotCharlie is Argentaâs virtual assistant. She lives within the Argenta mobile banking app and helps answer customersâ questions and complete transactions. But what makes her so helpful? She only chats when sheâs confident she can answer the question.âThe ProblemHow can we make a chatbot that improves customer experience?âArgenta is the fifth-largest bank in Belgium and its customer support team receives 20,000+ messages per month. It was impossible for their team of 23 agents to keep up. They were overloaded and overworked.âDuring the discovery phase of the project, we identified three areas where the agents were losing the most time:â1. Basic FAQsâ2. Basic intent detection and data capture for specific transactional flowsâ3. Conditional data detection and capture for increasing daily limitsâArgenta is known for its excellent customer service and wanted to ensure that customer satisfaction remained stable or improved when introducing the bot to its customers. With this specific challenge in mind, we introduced a few custom solutions that take Charlie from being a basic bot to a great bot.âThe solutionCharlie is a chatbot with a clear scope and near-perfect NLP modelâCharlie only chats when sheâs confident she can helpâLatching onto the concept that Charlie should maintain the status quo or improve customer satisfaction, we pivoted and approached her introduction differently: Sheâs a very respectable lady and only introduces herself when sheâs at least 85% sure she has the right answer.How is this possible? We developed a unique introduction and fallback system so that if she knows the answer, she shares it. If she doesnât, the conversation gets routed to a live agent, and the customer has the same experience they would normally have pre-Charlie.Conversation where Charlie is 62% sure of the right answer and immediately hands it off to a live agent to supportThe only change for the customer is that if their question can be automated, they receive an instant answer instead of queueing for a live agent. Itâs a win-win for the customer and the support team because both save time! The customer doesnât waste time queueing for a live agent and the live agent doesnât waste time answering a question that Charlie could easily automate.â Conversation where Charlie is 97% sure of the right answerCharlie has pre-defined areas of expertiseâBy not introducing herself unless sheâs confident in the answer, Charlie doesnât need to know everything. Together with the customer service team, we defined a clear scope of easy-to-answer, frequently asked questions. This translated into 30-40 intents covering approximately 15% of all incoming questions.Beginning with a small set of intents enabled us to test, train and monitor Charlieâs natural language processing (NLP) model to near perfection. When we first introduced her to real customers, we reviewed every interaction to ensure that she said the right thing and created a net positive customer experience. After a few weeks of intense monitoring and some minor tweaks, it became clear that Charlie knew what she was talking about and was ready to work independently.Charlie clarifies doubt instead of defaulting to âI donât knowââThe vocabulary associated with banking is complex and nuanced. Since many banking intents overlap with one another, we usually recommend working with entities, such as debit card, credit card, limit, etc. Using contextual entities, we built a unique entity fallback system. If Charlieâs between 70-85% sure of the intent, then she rephrases the intent as a question to confirm her suspicions. If she recognizes an entity, she responds with a custom menu that proposes the most asked intents related to that entity.Conversation where Charlie is 75% sure of the intent and confirms her understanding with a questionCharlie automates data capture to save everyone timeâBasic data capture is a time-sink for a live agent. It can take up to 10 min. for a user to respond with their name, address, email and phone number. Thatâs valuable time that an agent could use on more complex conversations.One of customersâ most frequently requested items is a new card reader. The batteries expire over time and customers ask for a replacement. This question is easy for a bot to recognize, so instead of bothering a live agent with this simple request, Charlie detects when a user is asking for a new card reader and responds with a data capture flow that captures the userâs name, address, email, etc. Charlie then forwards that information and the new card reader request to a specific team within Argenta, where they check the request and prep the card reader for dispatch.Converting a frequently requested manual process into a conversational flow saves Argenta time and provides users with an immediate solutionAnother frequently asked question is how customers can increase their daily transactional limit. For certain amounts, itâs an easy fix that Charlie can automate. But for amounts that exceed Ð25,000, the customer needs to answer some questions. Charlie can detect when a customer wants to increase their daily limit and can also detect if the amount exceeds Ð25,000 so she can already get answers to the questions before handing the conversation off to a live agent to make the final limit adjustment.Charlie helps a user adjust their limit to Ð13,000The resultsCharlie is a chatbot loved by colleagues and customersâCharlie saved the customer support team 24 days (192 hours) of work in the first month and a half, and theyâre grateful for her help. Independently, Charlie manages 20%+ of the incoming customer conversations end-to-end.âOur new colleague Charlie is doing really well. Because of her quick reaction to simple questions, we can focus on the real work ðâÂ Â Â Ilke Schiltz, Customer Support Agent @ ArgentaâThe most triggered flow was increasing daily transactional limits, followed by requesting a new card and then a new card reader. As Charlie continues to engage with and help customers, weâll broaden her banking knowledge so that she continues to save the customer support team time.24 DAYSOF WORK SAVED IN THE FIRST 1,5 MONTHS+20%CONVERSATIONS HANDLED FULLY BY CHARLIE+95%CONTACT CENTER CSATCompanyWorkPartnersJobsResourcesBlogThe Best Bots 2022AboutAbout CampfirePrivacy policyCopyright Â© 2022 Campfire AIThis site uses cookiesWe care about your data, and we'd use cookies only to improve your experience.

Well, they have a lot more in common than you might think. As the name suggests, HR is a human business, and humans communicate using language. Conversational AI uses natural language processing (NLP), which is essentially AI for language. Since language powers both HR and conversational AI, it makes sense that HR departments use conversational AI to automate tasks and processes that lead to better employee experiences. âThe HR department is the one team in a company that connects with every employee. Therefore, itâs no surprise that messages, requests, questions, etc. flood HR representatives. A lot of the incoming questions for HR teams are repetitive, easy to recognize and easy to answer. This is the trifecta for conversational AI automation, making chatbots a win-win for HR teams and employees. âThe benefits of conversational AI for HR teamsâð¾ Save time and resourcesâImagine how much time your HR team could save if they answered a question once instead of repeatedly answering it multiple times a week or day. By implementing a chatbot to answer employeesâ most frequently asked questions, an HR team can save anywhere from 10-20% of their time, depending on the scope.âð§¬ Focus on complex issuesâYou can repurpose the extra 10-20% of time that your HR team saves to focus on more complex issues. There are always a few employee cases that require extra follow-up, a meeting, some calls and whatnot, that your HR reps now have time to do. Instead of chaining your HR team to their email inbox answering simple questions, theyâre able to solve problems and support your employees. Thatâs the real objective of an HR employee anyway, right?ââ ï¸ Reduce human errorâMistakes happen. Whether you miss an email, send the wrong link, forget about a policy updateâ¦ HR managers are only human. Whereas a chatbot is programmed to follow a standardized logic with pre-defined responses, making small mistakes almost impossible. This way, HR managers donât waste time and energy memorizing the small details and can focus on the more complex issues mentioned above.âð¢ Reinforce your company cultureâA chatbot is a great way to reinforce your company culture and values. You can design its personality to be exactly who you want it to be, and itâll never have a bad day! Plus, itâs just as happy answering a question the first time as it is answering it the 200th time.âThe benefits of conversational AI for employeesââ¡ï¸ Immediate answersâA chatbot is available 24/7/365 and can answer an employeeâs question in seconds. There are no office hours, long queues or 2-week OoO messages.âð¯ Personalized experiencesâA chatbot integrates seamlessly with your company platforms, making it possible to identify your employees and tailor the bot responses to match their needs and profiles. For example, Kathy from the Chat Team messages the bot on Microsoft Teams and asks for a copy of her most recent payslip. The bot recognizes her work profile and matches it to her file on the company payroll system. The bot then retrieves the link for her most recent payslip and shares the PDF download link via the Teams chat. Personalizing answers based on an employee's profile is crucial for HR teams since most questions are specific to that employee.âð¤ Interactive communicationâItâs more enjoyable to chat and interact via conversation than create a ticket and send it out into cyberspace, hoping it lands in the correct inbox. By chatting, employees receive immediate recognition of their questions and can follow up with additional questions.âð± Integrated accessibilityâThese days we can integrate a chatbot on almost any channel. That way you can connect with your employees via a channel that they already use. Whether it be on your intranet, in a company app or via workplace messaging (Teams or Slack anyone?), itâs easier to ask a question rather than digging around in an old onboarding document or the internal organogram trying to find the email of your HR business partner.âWhat are the best use cases for HR chatbots?âThere are so many different ways a chatbot can support your HR Team. Here are some ideas to spark your interest:Conversational job applicationsScreen candidatesSchedule interviewsAnswer (prospective) employee frequently asked questionsBuild pre-boarding, onboarding and deboarding flowsGather employee feedbackFacilitate performance reviewsSubmit expensesRequest holidaysShare shift schedulesView payslipsFor a more detailed business case, check out our work for Proximus HR or dive deeper into the topic with 6 ways to use chatbots as part of your HR automation strategy.âWhat's next for HRÂ and conversational AI?âHR teams will continue to adopt conversational AI at varying rates depending on their companyâs digital maturity and willingness to innovate. Here are our predictions for how we think AI will change HR teams in the coming years.âMost large companies will have a robot on their HR teamsâRobots are available and scalable. As companies work towards digitization goals and automate internal processes, theyâll turn towards a bot for support. If youâre curious to know more, check out 5 reasons why your next hire should be an HR bot.âHandovers to online HR agents will replace shared HR email addressesâA great chatbot never works alone. Itâs usually backed up by a team of human colleagues who take over the conversation when the bot canât continue. This means that instead of employees actively sending a question to a shared HR email, theyâll start chatting with a chatbot. When the bot needs additional human support, itâll bring the employee directly in contact with an HR representative via an offload or live handover flow.âChatbots will become the centralized interface for all internal needsâInstead of having an email for payroll, a website for mobile expenses, an app for holiday requests and a phone number for healthcare benefits, we see all of this coming together in one chatbot. Not only is it easier for employees to useâ they just need to visit one placeâ itâs easier for HR teams to manage.âNLP will become the main engine behind process automationâSince HR is all about communication and language, it makes sense that conversational AI will become the main engine for automating HR tasks. From immediately answering questions to directing employees to the right contact, chatbots will take the lead in increasing HR efficiency.âBots will conduct screening interviewsâWe expect larger corporations to adopt bot-run screening interviews over the next few years. Asking basic questions and evaluating the responses compared to a clear rubric is a task that a bot can easily take over. Just as you would teach a junior recruiter what to look for in a candidate, you can teach a bot the same. Automating the screening process will free up recruiters to focus on the interviews where emotional intelligence is required.NameEmail AddressCOMPANY* I read and agree with Campfireâs Privacy PolicyHeck yes!

27,fire.ai post 5 ways to use conversational artificial intelligence in banking,"fire.ai post 5 ways to use conversational artificial intelligence in banking. 5 ways to use conversational artificial intelligence in banking AboutCasesBlogPartnersJobsð Let's Chat5 ways to use conversational artificial intelligence in bankingFebruary 21, 2019Itâs no surprise that the financial industry is perfect for applying artificial intelligence (AI)â banks, crypto companies and financial institutions have thousands of customers who use their services multiple times a day.âWe often receive the question from prospective banking clients: How can we use conversational AI? Here are 5 of the best ways to implement conversational AI in banking, insurance and crypto companies.âCustomer supportâSetting up a chatbot to answer repetitive customer questions such as: What is the BIC code? Â and Where can I find my routing number? is a no-brainer for any bank.These questions come in at high volumes, theyâre easy to recognize and the answers are relatively simpleâ usually, a short text, link or image can answer the userâs question. Letâs assume that What is the BIC code? represents 5% of the incoming questions. If you use a bot to automate that answer, you reduce your incoming question volume by 5%. FAQs are a great area to start with for your MVP (minimum viable product) because even with a small scope of ~20 intents, you can immediately experience the benefits of automation by reducing the volume of incoming questions and the time spent by your customer support agents answering them.âPlus, most customer support tools Sparkcentral, Zendesk, Freshdesk, etc.) have out-of-the-box connections to chatbot building software, so you can keep your existing technology stack. âKBCâs Kate is one of our favorite customer support chatbots automating conversations in the financial industry.Data captureâAnother area where banks tend to lose a lot of time is during data capture flows. Many financial procedures require additional information before completing a request. Sometimes asking for a userâs name, birthday and email can take up to 10 min. By using a virtual assistant to automate the data capture, you avoid having your agent wait for the customer to respond and the customer wait around to have the agent ask the next question. Itâs a win-win for both sides! âSome typical baking processes that require additional information and could benefit from automated data capture are:Raising daily limitsRequesting a new card readerOrdering foreign currencyCanceling or blocking a cardWeâre probably biased, but Argenta's Charlie is our favorite example of automated data capture in a banking app. Another great example is Belfiusâs myBo.Financial transactionsâForget logging into an app or, even worse, opening your computer. Encrypted messaging apps, like WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram make checking your balance, paying bills and transferring money between accounts easier than ever. And the best part? Customers can use an app they already have instead of installing a new one!âCheck out Capital Oneâs Eno and Rawbankâs Rawbot to see how they use conversational AI to execute financial transactions.Filing insurance claimsâFiling an insurance claim is never a fun process. But itâs even worse when you donât know what to do and have to wait for someone to help you. Developing an insurance claims chatbot is one of the more complex implementations, but the time saved and improved customer experience make this a huge cost savings opportunity in the long run. Instead of spending hours processing a single claim, AI automates the complete data capture, so a claims agent only needs to spend a few minutes reviewing the case.âWe can also use AI to detect fraudulent language and build flows within the chatbot that stop users from submitting fake claims or adapting existing claims to increase their insurance payout.âFor an excellent implementation of an insurance claims chatbot, take a look at Belfiusâs myBo.Coaching and budget managementâChatbots make great coaches for many reasons: theyâre always on time, they never tire of nagging and most importantly, they donât judge. Weâre human, and sometimes we need a (not so) gentle reminder to keep ourselves in line, especially when itâs about budget management. Sticking to a budget and reaching financial goals, such as saving for a house or retirement, require constant discipline.âBuilding a coach-like virtual assistant is one of the most challenging implementations because it requires integrating with your bankâs infrastructure and security requirements, engineering If This, Then That(IFTT) triggers and preparing for how the bot will handle conversations outside its scope.âOur personal favorite is Cleo. Sheâs sassy, honest and just the kind of girl to help keep your spending habits in line.

28,fire.ai smores what is conversational banking,"fire.ai smores what is conversational banking. What is conversational banking? AboutCasesBlogPartnersJobsð Let's ChatWhat is conversational banking?November 4, 2022Conversational banking is exactly what it sounds like: itâs when a financial institution uses conversational AI to answer banking and insurance questions. Put simply, itâs a bankâs chatbot.âConversational banking uses natural language processing (NLP), which is a fancy way of saying AI for words. Like any other chatbot, we built the NLP model using intents, expressions, entities and flows.ââââââââââWhen a user asks a chatbot a question, we refer to that as an expression. For example, the user asks, âHow do I cancel my credit card?â The bot processes the userâs expression and compares it to the different expressions within its NLP model. Each expression within the NLP model is associated with a specific intent, or answer to an expected question. The bot then assigns a confidence score to each intent, and based on the different thresholds and rules that we define, it responds to the user with the appropriate answer.A look into how a chatbot assigns confidence scoresâWhy is conversational AI interesting for the banking sector?âBanking is the perfect business case for conversational AI because banks and insurance providers have thousands of customers who use their services multiple times a day. This inevitably leads to problems that need solving and questions that need answering.Most of the incoming questions are repetitive, easy to recognize and easy to answer. This is the trifecta for conversational AI automation, making it a win-win for banks and customers.ââð¾ Save resourcesâOn average, banks implementing a basic chatbot save between 10-20% of an agentâs time. The customer support agents can repurpose their saved time to focus on more complex cases that need human attention.ââ Reduce human errorâHumans make mistakes; it just happens sometimes. Whereas a chatbot follows standardized, pre-programmed logic, making it almost impossible to make mistakes.âð¤³ Interact with customers where they areâA chatbot can live almost anywhere: on your website, in your app, WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, etc. By placing your chatbot where your customers already are, you widen your customer reach and reduce the barrier to connect.âð¸ Focus on upsellingâInstead of spending time answering the same question 20 times a day, a customer support agent can delegate these types of tasks to a chatbot. They then have the time to focus on resolving complex client issues and upselling clients.ââBenefits for customersââ¡ Instant answersâA chatbot is available 24/7 and can answer a userâs question in seconds. This is a significant contrast when compared to more traditional question-and-answer approaches. For example, think about when a customer had to wait on the phone line for 10-30 minutes for a representative to pick up or send an email and wait a few days for a response. With a chatbot, your customers ask whenever is most convenient for them and they receive an instant response. There are no opening hours, no queues and no waiting times.âð¯ Personalized experiencesâItâs easy to connect your chatbot to your CRM system. This allows you to identify your customers and tailor the conversation to their needs and profile. For example, if youâre logged into your banking app and trying to file an insurance claim, the bot can look up your existing policy and respond with an answer tailored to your insurance policy. Each userâs experience with the chatbot is customized and unique.âð¬ Interactive communicationâItâs much more enjoyable and efficient to have an interactive conversation rather than trying to fill out a form that doesnât allow you to express your problem or fighting with an IVR system that doesnât understand your request. Chatbots are flexible and trained to solve problems and answer questions.âð® Omni-channel accessibilityWe can place a chatbot on almost any channel, making it much easier for your customers to connect with you via the channel that they prefer. This allows them to seamlessly switch between channels and makes it a more convenient experience for everyone.âWhat are the best use cases for conversational banking?âLike any other industry, a chatbot can support all types of departments and roles. Here are some different implementations for banking chatbots:Answer frequently asked questionsSell new plans and upgradesRegister and onboard new clientsRemind users of upcoming payments and deadlinesCoach and motivate users to stick to their budget and savings goalsRequest a new card readerRaise your daily limitPlan your budgetCheck your balanceMake a transferPay your billsFile an insurance claimIf youâre eager to dive deeper into some actual business cases, check out our work for Argenta and Rawbank.âWhatâs next?âBanks will inevitably continue adopting conversational AI to automate frequently asked questions, execute transactions and streamline processes. Financial institutions that donât make this switch wonât be able to sustain the increasing volume of incoming questions and remain competitive.Are you interested in implementing a chatbot at your company?

29,fire.ai post how to use campfires bot audit checklist,"fire.ai post how to use campfires bot audit checklist. How to use Campfireâs Bot Audit Checklist AboutCasesBlogPartnersJobsð Let's ChatHow to use Campfireâs Bot Audit ChecklistFebruary 1, 2023Have you ever tested a bot and thought, Wow that was really great!, or possibly, OMG that was the worst experience ever!? Well, youâre not alone. Working for customers across all industries and countries, we needed to figure out a way to systematically understand what makes a bot good and what makes a bot bad. However, good and bad feel really subjective. This is our business, we need to be objective and tell our clients where to optimize and what to prioritize. Instead of trying to compare apples to oranges, we developed a system to objectively evaluate a botâs ability to quickly and easily answer user questions. This became our Bot Audit Checklist.Â Our audit checklist works with a 50-point scale and focuses on the four main pillars that are essential for a working bot:âNLP qualityConversational designStructure and flowsVisualizationâNLPÂ qualityNLP quality evaluates your botâs knowledge and how well it can correctly recognize user questions. The highest possible score for this section is 20 points and it accounts for 40% of the audit score. This section has the heaviest weight because if the NLP model doesnât work properly, then the bot doesnât work properly.Before testing the bot, you need a list of 15 questions that the bot SHOULD know based on its introduction, the placement (the context of a specific website, app, etc.) and what an average customer would ask. If youâre struggling to come up with questions, here are 10 generic questions to get you started:âFind a [something] near meBecome a customer/memberChange my [something]I lost/forgot [something]What is [something]I have a problem/issue with [something], [Something] is wrong/not working/brokenI didnât receive [something]How can I do [something]Talk to a human, contact infoÂ Do you speak [another language],Â  I speak [another language]From there, take your questions and adapt them based on the companyâs FAQ page. FAQ pages are a great source of information because itâs a complete set of frequently asked questions. Itâs also usually the starting point of the botâs knowledge because the info is already organized and theyâre sure to save human time since theyâre already identified as high-volume questions.Â Thatâs the only prep work you need to do! Now itâs onto the testing. Hereâs a breakdown of every item to test when evaluating the botâs NLP quality.Â âââIntent recognitionAsk the bot your 15 questions. For every rue positive, a question that the bot answers with an on-topic response that makes sense, you award 1 point. For every question that the bot doesnât answer correctly, youâll need to follow up with further questioning to decide whether itâs a false positive, false negative or true negative.Â A false positive occurs when the bot falsely understands the question and gives the wrong response. These are the easiest to spot.Â A false negative occurs when the bot falsely responds with a not understood answer. How do you know if the bot really doesnât know the answer? You need to follow up with rephrased variations of the question. If one of your rephrased questions gets a correct answer, then itâs a false negative since the bot did actually know the answer to your initial question, it just didnât understand the specific phrase you used. If none of your rephrased questions get a correct answer and the bot continues to respond with a not understood, then itâs a true negative, since the bot really doesnât seem to know the answer to your questions. âSubtract -0.5 points for every false positive and false negative that you experience. Award 0.5 points for every true negative that you uncover.Note down the results on your checklist and move on to the rest of the audit. Youâll total up everything at the end.Â âButtons and numbersHere youâre testing various types of input. If there are buttons within the chat, then the bot should recognize the button when itâs clicked and when itâs typed. If there are number menus, then the bot should recognize a number as text and as digits. If the bot can recognize these different types of input, award 1 point. If it canât, award 0.Â âEntitiesEntities help the NLP identify variations within an intent. Itâs easiest to think of them as keywords, that correspond to a list of synonyms. If the bot uses entities, award 1 point, if not award 0 points.Â ! TIP ! Looking for entities takes a bit of practice, but an easy way to check if a bot uses entities is to ask a question that has different answers based on a specifier. For example, âI broke somethingâ gives a generic answer with a follow-up question asking what you broke. âI broke my laptopâ gives a specific answer related to breaking your laptop, and âI broke my phoneâ gives a specific answer related to breaking your phone.Â  Laptop and phone are synonyms under an âitemâ entity.Â Language detectionThere are 55 countries in the world that have more than one official language, and approximately 60% of the world population speaks at least two languages or more. Switching from one language to another is a normal habit for lots of people. However, very few chatbots can detect, let alone accommodate that. Award 1 point if the chatbot can detect that youâre speaking another language. It doesnât need to offer to chat with you in that language, it just needs to understand that youâre speaking another language and gives a response that manages expectations about which language(s) it can speak. If thereâs no language detection, then award 0 points.Â âGibberish detectionRandomly smashing the keys on your keyboard results in gibberish that no one can or should be able to decipher. This happens more frequently than you might think in chatbot conversion. Instead of responding with a generic not understood response, some bots respond with a specific message encouraging users to stick to an official language that the bot knows. Award 1 point if the bot can detect gibberish and 0 points if it canât.Â âNatural Language Generation (NLG)Only using NLP will quickly become a habit of the past. Many companies are already experimenting with NLG to provide more human and personalized responses. As the technology advances, this section of the audit will probably grow, but for now, award 1 point if you discover the bot using NLG and 0 points if not.Â Conversational designConversational design focuses on the user experience and how the conversation is written and engineered. This is what distinguishes a bot from a functional question-answer machine to an interactive experience. The highest possible score for this section is 15 points, which accounts for 30% of the audit score.Â Within the scope of conversational design, we evaluate 12 different criteria. This is probably the least objective section of the audit, so weâll go through each criterion in detail and explain exactly what to look for and how to award points.Â Conversationalized copyÂ Conversationalized copy is text (or bot responses) that is written the same way people converse. If a botâs response is short (~125 characters per bubble), breaks longer messages into multiple bubbles and averages less than four bubbles per response, then you can consider it conversationalized copy.There are always certain responses that can be improved, but if a majority of the copy is conversationalized, then you should award 1 point. If there's little to no conversationalized copy, then award 0 points.Personalization and contextÂ Personalization refers to the botâs ability to use the knowledge that it already has. If the bot is placed in a logged-in environment, then the bot should already know all the personalized information associated with your account. This could be something as basic as your email, all the way down to your subscription plan, most recent purchases, etc.Â Context refers to the botâs ability to understand whatâs been said throughout the conversation and where you are in the conversation. For example, if you tell the bot you lost your sweater and it correctly detects that you lost something, then the next question shouldnât be: What did you lose? The bot should already know what you lost based on your initial message.Â If the bot uses personalization and/or context, then award 1 point. If thereâs no personalization and the context doesnât work, then award 0 points.! TIP ! An easy way to test for context is to find a button menu and type one of the button responses. Then return to the main menu and type the same thing you typed while in the flow. Compare those answers. If theyâre the same, then the bot probably isnât using context. If theyâre different, then the bot is using context.Â Copy variationsCopy variations make a bot feel less rigid and more spontaneous. For example, instead of always answering âDo you have another question?â, the bot sometimes says, âIs there something else I can help you with?â, or âCan I help you with anything else?âAward 1 point if you find copy variations, and 0 points if don't find any.! TIP ! The most common response variations to check are: Hello, Thank you, Another question, Bye.Userâs perspectiveWriting from the userâs perspective implies that the bot uses first-person pronouns. For example, when listing different options instead of saying,âYour number,â it says, âMy number,â since the user clicks the button and it appears as an input response. Award 1 point if the bot writes in the first person, and 0 points if it doesn't.Bot introductionItâs crucial for a chatbot to introduce itself as a bot. Not only will it soon be a law in Europe, but itâs also key for managing user expectations. If a bot clearly introduces itself as a chatbot, then you should award 1 point. If there's no clear introduction or it's not clear that the chat experience is run by a bot, then you should award 0 points.Expectation managementChatbots are all about expectation management. Giving a user a keyboard opens up the possibility to ask anything and everything. If a chatbot offers a menu or describes the types of topics or questions it can answer, then itâs narrowing the scope and guiding the user on what to ask. Award 1 point if the bot manages expectations and 0 points if it doesnât.Â âUnnecessarily block keyboardThere's nothing more frustrating than being trapped in a flow where the keyboard is blocked and none of the buttons match what you need. There are some cases when blocking a keyboard can be useful, however, those moments are rare. If the bot doesnât unnecessarily block the keyboard, then award 1 point. If you find a blocked keyboard that doesn't allow an escape or alternative, then award 0 points.âData/input validationLots of companies use bots to automate data capture and conversationalize forms. A crucial part of accurate data capture is input validation. Award 1 point when you find some form of data/input validation, whether it be an automated address, phone number or email check, or a simple ""review-and-confirm"" from the user. Award 0 points if thereâs no data/input validation.Implicit confirmationImplicit confirmation is one of the best tools when it comes to conversational design. It allows the bot to confirm that it correctly understood the user, while smoothly moving the conversation forward. For example, if the user asks for a coffee, the bot might respond with âWould you like milk with your coffee?â The bot isnât saying literally, âDo I understand correctly that you asked for a coffee?â Instead, itâs saying, âI understood that you ordered a coffee,â it smoothly moves the conversation forward by asking if youâd like milk with your coffee and it gives the user the opportunity to correct it if they didnât order a coffee. Award 1 point if the bot uses implicit confirmation and 0 points if it doesn't.Â IntegrationsIntegrations are technical connections between the bot and other platforms. They enable the bot to give more personalized and accurate responses. There are simple integrations, such as storing user feedback in an online spreadsheet, and very complex integrations such as connecting to a user's bank account and checking his/her current balance. Integrations bring a bot to the next level, so for every integration that you spot, award 2 points. Bots can score a maximum of 5 points for integrations.Trapped in a flow or loopThe ultimate failure of conversational design is getting stuck in an endless loop or a flow that a user can't escape. Not only is it frustrating, it means that the chatbot failed to do its job. Subtract 2 points for every time you get trapped in a flow or loop. You should cap the number of subtracted points at -10.Structure and flowsThe structure of a chatbot is the information architecture and the flows are specific scenarios where the bot guides the user through a process. The highest possible score for this section is 10 points and it accounts for 20% of the audit score. The scoring here is quite straightforward.Clear information architectureIf thereâs a clear information architecture with a knowledge hierarchy, such as a main menu and/or sub-menus, then you should award 1 point. If not, then 0 points.Â FallbacksFallbacks are the most complex part of this section and can use entities, database searches or offloads to ensure that the bot moves the conversation forward without saying, âIâm sorry, I donât understand.â Award 1 point every time you experience a fallback instead of a ânot-understoodâ message. Bots can score a maximum of 5 points for fallbacks.OffloadA bot canât and shouldnât answer everything. Thatâs why you should award 1 point to bots that propose some sort of offload, whether it be a live chat handover, ticket creation, phone number or email address. If thereâs no alternative form of communication to the not, then award 0 points.Â Feedback flowBots can always improve and learn. Award 1 point to bots that have some version of a feedback flow, whether itâs a thumbs up/thumbs down, star rating, smiley ranking or open feedback. If none of these exist, award 0 points.Â Double intent recognitionIn 99% of the cases when the bot identifies the same intent twice in a row itâs a wrong answer. This is frustrating for the user because theyâre trying to rephrase the question, but itâs still not triggering the right answer to his/her question. In this case, the best practice is to alert the user that it has the same answer twice in a row and ask the user if they want that same answer or propose some sort of offload instead. Award 1 point if the bot recognizes a double intent, and 0 points if it doesnât.Â âLanguage switchSince a majority of the population is at least bilingual, itâs very normal for a user to end up on a chatbot in his/her non-preferred language. This is why you should award 1 point to bots that can seamlessly switch from one language to another. Award 0 points if there's no language switch.VisualizationThis section evaluates how the bot looks and it has the smallest impact on the final score since design is always subjective. Itâs possible to score 5 points in this area and it accounts for 10% of the final score.Rich text/mediaTry to keep your evaluation of visualization as objective as possible by awarding 1 point to bots that use rich media to show instead of tell. Rich text and media include emojis, icons, images, videos, gifs, etc. Award 0 points if this is missing.Â FormatsAward 1 point to bots that use the best formats to simplify the user experience, such as lists, carousels, buttons, links, etc. If these are missing, award 0 points.Â ResponsivenessFinally, award 1 point per device (desktop, tablet and mobile) where the chat widget is responsive and works properly.Â The total scoreNow itâs time to calculate the total score! Add up the scores from each section. The final score is out of 50 points, so the higher the score, the better the bot performed.There you have it!

30,fire.ai case posts rawbank conversational banking bot campfire a i,"fire.ai case posts rawbank conversational banking bot campfire a i. The natural evolution of mobile banking into conversational banking AboutCasesBlogPartnersJobsð Let's ChatThe natural evolution of mobile banking into conversational bankingRawbot is Rawbankâs virtual assistant that customers can chat with to complete financial transactions, as well as ask questions. But what makes Rawbot so popular? Heâs easily accessible via the website, WhatsApp, Messenger, Instagram and Twitter.âThe ProblemHow can we replicate mobile banking within a WhatsApp chatbot?âAs the largest bank in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and with WhatsApp now the most-used messaging app in the country, Rawbank was looking for a way to bring traditional SMS banking to WhatsApp.* Itâs important to note that the financial landscape in Africa is unique because itâs historically built on mobile banking. With very few physical banks and unreliable internet connections, SMS banking was and continues to be the norm for sending and receiving payments.The project began purely focused on centralizing and automating questions coming from its +200,000 customers. However, Rawbankâs digital team quickly realized that they could also introduce financial transactions. The challenge then became how can we expand the MVP to:1. Enable secure financial transactions via WhatsApp2. Meet its customers where they are to answer their questionWith these two criteria in mind, we worked together with Rawbank to develop an omnichannel, conversational banking strategy.âThe solutionAn omnichannel chatbot approach for mobile bankingâEvolving from SMS to WhatsAppâWhen evolving from SMS to internet-based financial transactions, we first needed to overcome a few technical hurdles. Most importantly, there wasnât an easy plug-and-play API to connect natural language processing (NLP) and bot-building software to the existing infrastructure. Instead, we built a customized microservice that acts as a translator between the newer cloud models and existing telco infrastructure.One of the easier transitions from SMS to WhatsApp is that the mobile number remains the customerâs unique identifier. The other benefit is that by using WhatsApp thereâs additional security and encryption built into the platform. Itâs very difficult to hack WhatsApp and steal someoneâs login-- youâd basically have to steal someoneâs phone.For the MVP, we built two transactional flows. The first flow allows customers to check their balance in Congolese francs, euros and US dollars. The second flow allows customers to check their most recent transactions. The next version of Rawbot will include transactional flows that allow customers to send and receive money via WhatsApp.Bank balance conversational flowIntroducing conversational AI to mobile bankingâTo start with conversational banking, we agreed on a scope of 50 intents that cover the most frequently asked questions from Rawbank customers. Since the vocabulary associated with banking is very specific and because many banking intents overlap with one another, we usually recommend working with entities, such as debit card, credit card, limit, etc. Using contextual entities instead of match entities, allows us to create a fallback system, so that instead of responding with âI donât know,â Rawbot can clarify any doubts himself.Intent and entity fallback systemIf Rawbotâs between 70-85% sure of the intent, then he rephrases the intent as a question to confirm his suspicions. If heâs between 50-100% certain of the entity, he responds with a custom menu that proposes the most asked intents related to that entity. This approach enables Rawbot to resolve a majority of the incoming questions end-to-end so that only a small percentage of complex cases get passed on to Rawbankâs internal support team.Tailoring the conversational design to match each channelâFor Rawbot to be a success, it had to be easily accessible by Rawbank customers. The only way to achieve this was by adopting an omnichannel approach so that Rawbot was available on channels where Rawbank customers were already active.Technically speaking, connecting a bot to different channels is quite simple. However, designing an omnichannel conversational strategy is much more difficult. It requires modifications and redesigns per channel so that the user has the best possible experience.Every channel and platform is different. From the way the user interacts with the channel, to the context, interface, visualizations, technical restrictions, etc. For example, a chatbot begins the conversation by immediately introducing itself when the web chat is opened. However, on WhatsApp, the user must begin the conversation, which means that we had to foresee two different introduction flows.Other differences are related to the channel interface and technical abilities. In a web chat, we can use carousels to visually highlight different options, but that feature isnât available in WhatsApp, so we need to use a menu to present options.Rawbot's web menu carrouselOr on Messenger, we can use buttons to help the user make quick choices, while on Twitter that feature doesnât exist, so we need to use numbers.Rawbot's Whatsapp menuThe resultsUsers are making the switch from SMS banking to WhatsApp bankingâRawbot chats with +6,500 customers a month. Half of those customers interact with him on WhatsApp, while the other half is divided among the website, Messenger, Instagram and Twitter.These numbers continue to grow each month and we see that more and more customers are using WhatsApp to check their balances and most recent transactions. The transactional flows are triggered +800 times per month, and the next Rawbot release will include transactional payment flows where users can send and receive money through WhatsApp.800 +MONTHLY TRIGGERS FOR TRANSACTIONS6500 +MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS4ACTIVE ON DIFFERENT CHANNELSCompanyWorkPartnersJobsResourcesBlogThe Best Bots 2022AboutAbout CampfirePrivacy policyCopyright Â© 2022 Campfire AIThis site uses cookiesWe care about your data, and we'd use cookies only to improve your experience.

38,fire.ai post 6 ways to use chatbots as part of your hr automation strategy,"fire.ai post 6 ways to use chatbots as part of your hr automation strategy. 6 ways to use chatbots as part of your HR automation strategy AboutCasesBlogPartnersJobsð Let's Chat6 ways to use chatbots as part of your HR automation strategyNovember 4, 2022Human resources (HR) is a department that relies entirely on communication and conversation. So it makes sense that conversational AI is one of the best solutions when looking into automation options for the HR team. Chatbots allow HR teams to scale their conversations while keeping things personal.âHere are some ways you can use a chatbot to support your HR department.âAnswering employee questionsâEmployees have questions; itâs normal. And depending on the size of the company, the volume of questions can be pretty high. The nice thing about a question for the HR team is that if one employee has it, thereâs a high chance others will have the same question. This means that many of the questions are repetitiveâ which is one of the key characteristics of automation.âBy automating basic questions like, How do I ask for time off? or How do I get a replacement badge?, your HR Managers have more time to follow up on more complex cases. Plus, a botâs available 24/7, so employees can get a response immediately, instead of waiting for an HR Manager to wade through their overflowing inbox to respond. âOne of our all-time favorite HR chatbots is Proximusâs YODA, who helps answer +6,600 questions per month.Automating employee onboardingâA chatbot is a perfect onboarding assistant because it can help HR teams automate frequently overlooked processes that are time-consuming and repetitive.âAccording to research by the Brandon Hall Group, strong employee onboarding can increase new hire retention by 82%. However, Sapling estimates that the average onboarding process includes 54 different activities. Of these activities, a majority of them are administrative and include questions such as What keyboard format do you want?, Whoâs your emergency contact?, Do you need a standing desk?, etc. These are all questions that a chatbot can easily automate. Plus, itâs always nicer to answer these questions from the comfort of your desk, instead of sitting in a meeting room while the HR Manager awkwardly watches you complete all the forms. âAnother reason an onboarding chatbot is so helpful is that itâs basically your new employeeâs single point of contact and is always accessible. When starting a new job, itâs normal to have questions, but in many cases, you donât know who to ask and donât want to bother someone whoâs busy with a silly question. Integrating an employee onboarding flow within a company FAQ chatbot gives your new hires instant support whenever they need it.Simplifying recruitmentâRecruiting is expensive and time-consuming. SHRM estimates in its 2022 benchmarking reports that the average cost per hire is $4,700. SHRM also calculates that it takes ~33 days to fill a position. And the even crazier part?! You can use a chatbot to automate most of the tasks in the recruitment funnel. âA recruitment chatbot can support a variety of repetitive recruiting tasks, such as answering questions about the company, submitting applications, pre-screening, scheduling interviews, confirming next steps, sending offers, etc. âWeâre still looking for a recruitment bot to fall in love with. So if you have some great examples, feel free to share them with us via WhatsApp. Or even better, if youâre looking to build a recruitment bot, get in touch with Alexis so that we can build one everyone loves together!âImproving employee engagementâChatbots are a great way to stimulate employee engagement. They donât judge, theyâre always available and you only have to talk to them when youâre in the mood. âWhen it comes to employee engagement, bots are a great way to regularly collect authentic employee feedback. Theyâre more personal, casual and relevant than an annual survey sent by mail every March. Why? Because itâs easier to respond to how youâre feeling about a company initiative when it happens, rather than trying to remember what the initiative was 4 months later when the annual survey pops up in your inbox. Itâs also more natural to respond in a conversational format, and using emojis can help express emotions. Plus a bot can ask follow-up questions or use buttons to keep the conversation moving forward.âStandardizing performance managementâSimilar to employee engagement, performance management isnât something that you should leave for one moment of the year. Growth happens throughout the year and for an employee to successfully improve and learn, there should be regular evaluations and check-ins. âThis usually panics managers because if you manage a multi-person team, then youâll probably end up spending more time reviewing your teamâs performance than working with them, right? Wrong. Let a chatbot automate performance management for you. By implementing short, regular feedback moments throughout the year that the bot manages, youâll increase transparency and automate the reminders, input collection and follow-up.Executing employee transactionsâSimilar to conversational banking, HR bots can help automate conversational transactions, such as viewing recent payslips, calculating an employeeâs remaining holidays, submitting expenses, etc. Instead of housing this information on different platforms with different logins, make it as easy to access as having a conversation with a friend. Trust us, your employees will thank you for this major upgrade in user experience.ââNameEmail AddressCOMPANY* I read and agree with Campfireâs Privacy PolicyHeck yes!

A chatbot that can support travelers 24/7â AboutCasesBlogPartnersJobsð Let's ChatA chatbot that can support travelers 24/7âTraveling is an activity that happens in different time zones and outside of the traditional office hours. However people sometimes need instant support. Artificial intelligence allows us to easily overcome the limitations of different time zones and traditional office hours by creating a chatbot that's available to support users 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a year.ââThe ProblemTravelers need immediate supportâDiscover EU is an initiative led by the European Commission (E.C.) that helps 18-year-old E.U. citizens discover Europe by train. Many of these young Europeans are inexperienced, first-time travelers who find themselves in situations where they need immediate help (ex. I missed my train, what do I do now?). However, it's costly and challenging to staff a large team of support agents outside traditional office hours and across different time zones.To guarantee affordable, real-time support for young travelers, we worked with the E.C. to develop a chatbot that's always available to answer young travelers' questions.The solutionA chatbot with a customized handoverâWe began the project by reviewing Discover EU's database of user questions and identifying the 20 most frequently asked questions. This set of questions and answers became the foundation of the chatbot. We strengthened this chatbot implementation, by customizing the handover between the bot and a live agent. In cases when the bot can't solve a user's problem, we transition the user from the conversation with the bot to a conversation with a live support agent. During this transition, we use A.I. to tag the conversation with keywords and relevant information. These smart tags help the agents quickly understand and prioritize the conversations.âThe resultsAutomated support that's always availableâIn the first month, the chatbot solved more 700+ questions and handed over approximately 150 questions to a live support agent. By automating 83% of the support requests, we solved travelers' problems faster and gave the support agents the time and space to focus on more complicated requests.~10Kmessages per month96%of all incoming questions are understood94%of users are satisfiedCompanyWorkPartnersJobsResourcesBlogThe Best Bots 2022AboutAbout CampfirePrivacy policyCopyright Â© 2022 Campfire AIThis site uses cookiesWe care about your data, and we'd use cookies only to improve your experience.

43,fire.ai cases cases argenta meet charlie,"fire.ai cases cases argenta meet charlie. Meet Charlie, Belgium's most helpful customer support chatbot AboutCasesBlogPartnersJobsð Let's ChatMeet Charlie, Belgium's most helpful customer support chatbotCharlie is Argentaâs virtual assistant. She lives within the Argenta mobile banking app and helps answer customersâ questions and complete transactions. But what makes her so helpful? She only chats when sheâs confident she can answer the question.âThe ProblemHow can we make a chatbot that improves customer experience?âArgenta is the fifth-largest bank in Belgium and its customer support team receives 20,000+ messages per month. It was impossible for their team of 23 agents to keep up. They were overloaded and overworked.âDuring the discovery phase of the project, we identified three areas where the agents were losing the most time:â1. Basic FAQsâ2. Basic intent detection and data capture for specific transactional flowsâ3. Conditional data detection and capture for increasing daily limitsâArgenta is known for its excellent customer service and wanted to ensure that customer satisfaction remained stable or improved when introducing the bot to its customers. With this specific challenge in mind, we introduced a few custom solutions that take Charlie from being a basic bot to a great bot.âThe solutionCharlie is a chatbot with a clear scope and near-perfect NLP modelâCharlie only chats when sheâs confident she can helpâLatching onto the concept that Charlie should maintain the status quo or improve customer satisfaction, we pivoted and approached her introduction differently: Sheâs a very respectable lady and only introduces herself when sheâs at least 85% sure she has the right answer.How is this possible? We developed a unique introduction and fallback system so that if she knows the answer, she shares it. If she doesnât, the conversation gets routed to a live agent, and the customer has the same experience they would normally have pre-Charlie.Conversation where Charlie is 62% sure of the right answer and immediately hands it off to a live agent to supportThe only change for the customer is that if their question can be automated, they receive an instant answer instead of queueing for a live agent. Itâs a win-win for the customer and the support team because both save time! The customer doesnât waste time queueing for a live agent and the live agent doesnât waste time answering a question that Charlie could easily automate.â Conversation where Charlie is 97% sure of the right answerCharlie has pre-defined areas of expertiseâBy not introducing herself unless sheâs confident in the answer, Charlie doesnât need to know everything. Together with the customer service team, we defined a clear scope of easy-to-answer, frequently asked questions. This translated into 30-40 intents covering approximately 15% of all incoming questions.Beginning with a small set of intents enabled us to test, train and monitor Charlieâs natural language processing (NLP) model to near perfection. When we first introduced her to real customers, we reviewed every interaction to ensure that she said the right thing and created a net positive customer experience. After a few weeks of intense monitoring and some minor tweaks, it became clear that Charlie knew what she was talking about and was ready to work independently.Charlie clarifies doubt instead of defaulting to âI donât knowââThe vocabulary associated with banking is complex and nuanced. Since many banking intents overlap with one another, we usually recommend working with entities, such as debit card, credit card, limit, etc. Using contextual entities, we built a unique entity fallback system. If Charlieâs between 70-85% sure of the intent, then she rephrases the intent as a question to confirm her suspicions. If she recognizes an entity, she responds with a custom menu that proposes the most asked intents related to that entity.Conversation where Charlie is 75% sure of the intent and confirms her understanding with a questionCharlie automates data capture to save everyone timeâBasic data capture is a time-sink for a live agent. It can take up to 10 min. for a user to respond with their name, address, email and phone number. Thatâs valuable time that an agent could use on more complex conversations.One of customersâ most frequently requested items is a new card reader. The batteries expire over time and customers ask for a replacement. This question is easy for a bot to recognize, so instead of bothering a live agent with this simple request, Charlie detects when a user is asking for a new card reader and responds with a data capture flow that captures the userâs name, address, email, etc. Charlie then forwards that information and the new card reader request to a specific team within Argenta, where they check the request and prep the card reader for dispatch.Converting a frequently requested manual process into a conversational flow saves Argenta time and provides users with an immediate solutionAnother frequently asked question is how customers can increase their daily transactional limit. For certain amounts, itâs an easy fix that Charlie can automate. But for amounts that exceed Ð25,000, the customer needs to answer some questions. Charlie can detect when a customer wants to increase their daily limit and can also detect if the amount exceeds Ð25,000 so she can already get answers to the questions before handing the conversation off to a live agent to make the final limit adjustment.Charlie helps a user adjust their limit to Ð13,000The resultsCharlie is a chatbot loved by colleagues and customersâCharlie saved the customer support team 24 days (192 hours) of work in the first month and a half, and theyâre grateful for her help. Independently, Charlie manages 20%+ of the incoming customer conversations end-to-end.âOur new colleague Charlie is doing really well. Because of her quick reaction to simple questions, we can focus on the real work ðâÂ Â Â Ilke Schiltz, Customer Support Agent @ ArgentaâThe most triggered flow was increasing daily transactional limits, followed by requesting a new card and then a new card reader. As Charlie continues to engage with and help customers, weâll broaden her banking knowledge so that she continues to save the customer support team time.24 DAYSOF WORK SAVED IN THE FIRST 1,5 MONTHS+20%CONVERSATIONS HANDLED FULLY BY CHARLIE+95%CONTACT CENTER CSATCompanyWorkPartnersJobsResourcesBlogThe Best Bots 2022AboutAbout CampfirePrivacy policyCopyright Â© 2022 Campfire AIThis site uses cookiesWe care about your data, and we'd use cookies only to improve your experience.
